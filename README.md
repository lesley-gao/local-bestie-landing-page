## Introduction of the Webpage

This webpage presents Local Bestie, a dual-sided platform with separate landing pages for businesses (offering AI-powered marketing tools and revenue growth solutions) and customers (featuring personalised local discovery and cashback rewards), designed with reusable components for optimal user experience.

On the page, under the "Download the App" section, the two store buttons are intended to redirect users to their respective app store platforms.
⚠️ Please note: These links are currently placeholders and will be updated with the actual app store URLs once available.
